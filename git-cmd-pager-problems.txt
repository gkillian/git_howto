git config --global pager.diff=false

--no-pager to git will tell it to not use a pager. Passing the option -F to
less will tell it to not page if the output fits in a single screen.

Usage:
git --no-pager diff


Other options from the comments include:
# set an evaporating environment variable to use cat for your pager
GIT_PAGER=cat git diff

# tell less not to paginate if less than a page
export LESS="-E -F -X $LESS"
# ...then git as usual
git diff
