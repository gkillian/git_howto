# Branches versus Tags
#
# What's the difference between tags and branches? The workspace is (almost always) 
# associated with a branch, called master by default. When it is, a commit will 
# automatically update the master reference to point to that new commit; in other words, 
# branches are mutable references.
#
# A tag, on the other hand, is created to point to a specific commit and thereafter does 
# not change, even if the branch moves on. In other words, tags are immutable references.
#

# listing tags
git tag

# search for a specific pattern

git tag -l "v1.8.5*"

# create a tag

git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"

# lightweight tag (only creates a checksum
#
#    don't supply the -a, -s, or -m option

git tag v1.4-1w


# sharing tags: you have to explicityly push

git push origin v1.5

# if you want to push a lot of tags (more than one)
git push origin --tags


#  Checking out Tags
#
# You canelly check out a tag in Git, since they can't be moved around. 
# If you want to put a version of your repository in your working directory
# that looks like a specific tag, you can create a new branch at a specific 
# tag with git checkout -b [branchname] [tagname]:

$ git checkout -b version2 v2.0.0
Switched to a new branch 'version2'
